	<div><h9><p>My hunger for knowledge and determination to turn information into action has contributed to my most recent success at Commutatus placement exam round one. 
Meanwhile, I learned multiple programming tools like java, python, and c. I also lead the electronics domain of the college team named Recon Subsea to success by winning the design innovation award in MATE regional competition. I am also working on a research project on the thermoelectric generation.  I love working on challenging tasks and things that need creativity and thinking. Eagerness to find a solution to problems is my driving force. I love cycling, football, cooking food.</p>
